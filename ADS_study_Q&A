- Solving recurrence equations for runtime analysis of recursive algorithms

<details>
<summary>How can you describe the running time of a recursive algorithm?</summary>
<br>
By a recurrence equation that describes a function in terms of its value on smaller input.

<summary>What is a full binary tree?</summary>
<br>
A binary tree in which each

-  node is either a leaf, or 
-  has a degree that is exactly 2 (number of children). 
-  Put differently: each node has either degree zero or degree 2.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Complete binary tree?</summary>
<br>
A binary tree in which ALL leaves have the same depth 

and all internal nodes have degree 2.

You never create a new level before finishing the previous level.

All leave nodes must be at the same level.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is a heap?</summary>
<br>
A nearly complete binary tree with the two following properties;

1. Structural property: all levels are full, except possibly the last one, which is filled from left to right.
2. Order/heap property: for any node $i$ parent($i$) $\geq$ i.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the distance to the root?</summary>
<br>
The number of nodes you have to pass through form a leaf for reaching the node. In this case you do NOT count the leave but only the nodes you have to pass throgh.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the height of a heap?</summary>
<br>
It is $
